- Include refraction and reflection effects
- Add realistic shattering patterns based on impact force
- Optimize for smooth performance (60fps priority)

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Sound System
**Priority**: HIGH (User requested sounds)

**Current Issues:**
- No actual sound files in assets
- Basic Web Audio API usage
- No audio feedback for interactions

**Planned Improvements:**
- Create comprehensive sound library
- Add audio feedback for all game interactions
- Implement phonics sounds for letters
- Add ambient background sounds
- Include satisfying pop/explosion sounds

### Phase 3: New Phonics Bubble Level
**Priority**: HIGH (User specifically requested)

**Scope:**
- Create dedicated phonics level focusing on letter sounds
- Implement bubble mechanics with popping physics
- Design level in optimized subfolder structure
- Include phonetic audio feedback
- Simple, robust, and appealing design

**Features:**
- Bubbles containing letters float up
- Players pop bubbles to hear phonetic sounds
- Progressive difficulty with letter combinations
- Visual feedback with particle effects
- Sound-based learning focus

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish
**Priority**: HIGH (Smooth gameplay is highest priority)

**Optimizations:**
- Enhance particle system with object pooling
- Optimize collision detection
- Add visual polish to existing levels
- Implement smooth animations
- Ensure 60fps performance
