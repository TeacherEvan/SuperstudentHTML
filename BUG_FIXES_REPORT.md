## Bug 1: Memory Leak in InputHandler - Event Listener Cleanup Issue

### **Severity**: High
### **Type**: Memory Leak / Resource Management
### **File**: `src/js/inputHandler.js`

### **Description**
The `InputHandler` class had a critical memory leak where event listeners were not properly cleaned up in certain scenarios. Specifically:

1. **Incomplete Cleanup**: The `destroy()` method only cleaned up event listeners if the canvas was still available, but if the canvas was set to null before cleanup, the listeners would remain attached to the DOM.

2. **Array Reference Issue**: Listener arrays were being reassigned (`[]`) instead of being properly emptied, which could leave references to callback functions in memory.

3. **Missing Bound Function Cleanup**: The bound function references weren't being cleared, keeping function objects in memory.

### **Impact**
- Memory leaks over time as the game runs
- Potential performance degradation
- Ghost event listeners firing even after component destruction
- Possible browser crashes on memory-constrained devices

### **Fix Applied**
```javascript
// Before (Problematic)
destroy() {
  if (this.canvas) {
    this.canvas.removeEventListener('pointerdown', this._boundHandlePointerDown);
    // ... other removals
  }
  this.pointerDownListeners = []; // Creates new array, doesn't clear references
}

// After (Fixed)
destroy() {
  const originalCanvas = this.canvas;
  if (originalCanvas) {
    originalCanvas.removeEventListener('pointerdown', this._boundHandlePointerDown);
    // ... other removals
  }
  
  // Properly clear arrays instead of reassigning
  this.pointerDownListeners.length = 0;
  
  // Clear bound function references
  this._boundHandlePointerDown = null;
  // ... clear other bound functions
}
```

### **Benefits**
- Prevents memory leaks
- Ensures proper cleanup regardless of canvas state
- Improves long-term game stability
- Better performance on resource-constrained devices

## Bug 2: Renderer Canvas Setup Division by Zero Issue

### **Severity**: Critical
### **Type**: Runtime Error / Stability
### **File**: `src/js/core/engine/renderer.js`

### **Description**
The `Renderer` class had a critical bug in the `setupCanvas()` method where:

1. **Division by Zero**: `getBoundingClientRect()` could return width/height of 0, especially during initial page load or when the canvas is hidden.

2. **Invalid Canvas Dimensions**: Setting canvas dimensions to 0 or negative values causes rendering issues.

3. **No Fallback Values**: The code didn't handle cases where the canvas might not be properly sized in the DOM.

### **Impact**
- Application crashes with division by zero errors
- Invisible or corrupted game rendering
- Inconsistent behavior across different browsers
- Game failing to start on certain devices or screen configurations

### **Fix Applied**
```javascript
// Before (Problematic)
setupCanvas() {
  const { width, height } = this.canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  this.canvas.width = width * (window.devicePixelRatio || 1);
  this.canvas.height = height * (window.devicePixelRatio || 1);
  // ... could result in 0 dimensions
}

// After (Fixed)
setupCanvas() {
  const rect = this.canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  const width = rect.width || this.canvas.offsetWidth || 800; // Fallback to 800px
  const height = rect.height || this.canvas.offsetHeight || 600; // Fallback to 600px
  
  // Ensure minimum dimensions to prevent division by zero
  const minWidth = Math.max(width, 1);
  const minHeight = Math.max(height, 1);
  
  const devicePixelRatio = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
  
  // Set canvas internal dimensions
  this.canvas.width = minWidth * devicePixelRatio;
  this.canvas.height = minHeight * devicePixelRatio;
  // ... rest of setup
}
```

### **Benefits**
- Prevents runtime crashes
- Ensures consistent rendering across all devices
- Provides fallback dimensions for edge cases
- Improves game initialization reliability

## Bug 3: Sound Manager Resource Management and Audio Context Issue

### **Severity**: High
### **Type**: Resource Management / Performance / Stability
### **File**: `src/js/core/audio/soundManager.js`

### **Description**
The `SoundManager` class had multiple critical issues:

1. **Audio Context Error Handling**: No error handling for AudioContext creation, which fails on some browsers or configurations.

2. **Suspended Audio Context**: The playSound method didn't handle the case where the AudioContext was suspended (common in modern browsers due to autoplay policies).

3. **Resource Leak**: Active sounds weren't being properly tracked and cleaned up, leading to memory leaks.

4. **Parameter Validation**: No bounds checking on volume and pitch parameters could cause audio distortion or crashes.

5. **Exception Handling**: No try-catch blocks around audio operations that could fail.

### **Impact**
- Complete audio system failure on certain browsers
- Memory leaks from orphaned audio sources
- Audio distortion from invalid parameters
- Performance degradation over time
- Potential browser crashes from excessive audio resource usage

### **Fix Applied**

#### Constructor Error Handling:
```javascript
// Before (Problematic)
constructor() {
  this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
  // ... could throw error
}

// After (Fixed)
constructor() {
  try {
    this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create AudioContext:', error);
    this.audioContext = null;
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of initialization
}
```

#### Enhanced playSound Method:
```javascript
// Before (Problematic)
playSound(name, volume = 1.0, pitch = 1.0) {
  const source = this.audioContext.createBufferSource();
  source.playbackRate.value = pitch; // No bounds checking
  source.start(0); // No error handling
  return source;
}

// After (Fixed)
playSound(name, volume = 1.0, pitch = 1.0) {
  // Check if audio context is available
  if (!this.audioContext) {
    console.warn('AudioContext not available, cannot play sound');
    return null;
  }
  
  // Resume audio context if suspended
  if (this.audioContext.state === 'suspended') {
    this.audioContext.resume().catch(err => {
      console.warn('Failed to resume audio context:', err);
    });
  }
  
  // ... parameter validation and resource tracking
  
  try {
    source.start(0);
    this.activeSoundsCount++;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to start audio source:', error);
    this.activeSoundsList.delete(source);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### **Benefits**
- Prevents audio system crashes
- Handles modern browser autoplay policies
- Eliminates memory leaks from audio sources
- Provides graceful degradation when audio is unavailable
- Improves overall game stability and performance
