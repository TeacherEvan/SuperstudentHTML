# Bubble Pop Assets

Place your letter sound mp3 files (`a.mp3` through `z.mp3`) inside `sounds/letters/` and a generic `pop.mp3` inside `sounds/`.

Directory structure expected:
```
assets/bubblePop/
  sounds/
    pop.mp3
    letters/
      a.mp3
      b.mp3
      ...
      z.mp3
  sprites/
    blueBubble.png  (optional)
```

If these files are missing the game will still run but letter sounds will be silent.
